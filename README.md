An application that brings together a lot of totally useless input modifications in Windows.

The user interface is very simple and very eeasy to use, and it uses System Tray technology so that you can close the window and enjoy the features

List of implemented or yet to implement features:

:heavy_check_mark: Infinite screen (if the mouse goes full right, it reapears on the left side)  
:heavy_check_mark: Azerty to Qwerty keyboard (only alpha keys are modified at the moment)  
:x: Invert X and Y mouse positions  
:x: Create shortcuts (this feature is available in every good Linux desktop environments but not in windows?? too bad)
