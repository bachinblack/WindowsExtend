# WindowsExtend
An application that brings together a lot of totally useless input modifications in Windows.

The user interface is very simple and very easy to use.  
It's a System Tray application so the program keep running when the window is closed, and everything can be managed from the notify icon.


List of implemented or yet to implement features:

:heavy_check_mark: Infinite screen (if the mouse goes full right, it reapears on the left side)  
:heavy_check_mark: Azerty to Qwerty keyboard (only alpha keys are modified at the moment)  
:heavy_check_mark: Invert X and Y mouse positions  
:x: Create shortcuts (this feature is available in every good Linux desktop environments but not in windows?? too bad)  
:x: Save preferences  
:x: Loopback mic sound (when you wear your headset but you would like to hear your voice)  
:x: Change screen's brightness (the new windows 10' brightness system (with the 0/25/60/75/100% steps) is stupid)
